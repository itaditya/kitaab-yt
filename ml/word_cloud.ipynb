       "\" hi guys this is Boston again from coding this Matt Wacom and today in this new video tutorial I'd like to talk about progressive web applications some pwace and pwace again more and more popularity at the moment and it's very likely that you already have been using a PWA without noticing for example if you take Twitter comm this is the there's a website which is already using progressive web application our functionality and in this tutorial I will explain what are the main building blocks of a progressive web application and then we will explore how we can take an existing website and edit those building blocks to the project and enhance that website was features of a progressive web application so first of all we need a website and to make it very easy we will just use a template which is available here at start of bootstrap calm and start bootstrap calm offers you a free bootstrap based on website themes and templates and it's pretty much okay because we only need a website where we can apply progressive web app functionality to and to get that website we will use here a template which is called freelancer and this template is Weibull at start bootstrap comm slash template - over views - freelancer of course you are free to use any other template any other website this is just an example that we have something where we can start was and adding the features we would like to talk about so to get started here with the template just hit a download button here and it's downloading a zip file here and now we can extract it to a folder of your choice and then start working with project so Kay have already extracted that zip file and here in that folder a waa - test - the one and we can take a look inside you can see all here are the files of the project and that is there is our starting point here and I'd like to run a development web server here so that the website is hosted here on my machine and I'm using a live server which is a web Latin NPM package so if you have not used last server before you can install it by executing 10 p.m. install - G live - server this command is installing live server globally on your system I have already installed live server and that's the reason why the command live server is a Weibull and if I execute live server here within my project directory hitting return here you can see it's starting up a web server on my machine port 8080 and the web site is running here and you can see that still the freelancer template it's just one one site here I have a navigation menu here I can click on the items and go here to the different sections on that page ok so the first building block which I'd like to add to my application for progressive web application gives the web app manifest file of weapon manifest is a file which is written in JSON format and is containing some information about the application of the name the answer and so on end what's also included are the icons of the application because a progressive web application is an application which is intended to look and feel like a native app or like desktop application so we need an app icon here so that if you access the page for example on your mobile device or your tablet you are able to add to the application to your home screen and so that the icon for the application is on your home screen and that you can later on click on that item to go back to the page again so we need as one part of creating the web app manifest file we need to add the items to the JSON structure but first of all of course we need the icons itself and we will meet the icons in different sizes so that we can provide the right sizes for any platform the user is using and their entity I can here for our sample application we can use the file you can see it here I've already opened up the project structure here in my favorite code editor which is atom inside the IMG folder there is a file which is called profile dot PNG and that is the arm the image which is displayed here right on the start page at the very top and we will use that image and establish that image as the app icon and to do that we need to add it to the web app manifest file we are going to create and of course we need to disarm convert that PNG file to different and to do that we are using a web-based service next so the service I'd like to use is a Weibull at five icon - generator dark let's website here you can see it's presenting a simple form which we need to fill out first we need to select the image here and we are selecting the profile PNG image from our project here then the first setting we can leave it the option general items for web Android Microsoft and iOS apps we would like to maintain the image dimensions and I'd like to deactivate the option include your fav icon dot ICO in the public general gallery that's not needed and with that settings here I can then click on the button create five icon and you can see it directly takes me to the result page where it can find a download link here which contains some zip or which is pointing to it zip file which contains my my icons in the various sizes I do need and what's also included here in the download section is that code excerpt here with some HTML elements which I need to include in my index dot HTML but first of all let's download the zip file here ok like so so now I have downloaded this zip file here into my IMG folder of my project that's the file and now I double-click on that file to extracted this one can be removed here and the extracted folder here I'm renaming that folder to let's say icons okay like so I can see it here in my project structure as well and here can see it's now showing all the PNG files which have been generated by faff icon generator to dark and if I click on the files you can see the different sizes which are now available here so the next thing we need to do is to include the HTML text here from the result page in our application so let's select that HTML code here on the website copy it and then I'm going to index the HTML okay here we are and within the head section I'm including all those elements ok like so and now you can see we are having link elements here for our icons and we are having a link element here for which is of rel manifest and which is pointing to a file which is called manifest dot JSON and that file is a Weibull here and here you can see that's already a web app manifest file you can see here that are adjacent content but so far it's containing only the name property which is set to tab and it's containing the icons property which are set to an array containing objects and each object describing one of the icons we have generated ok in on in the next step we will further adapt that money not J's and five-year we will use this file as our web app manifest file but beside having the icons included here we do need some more properties here describing our application in a total and that is what we're going to edit the next step before doing so we need to adapt the path to our icons a little bit a little bit first of all we're doing the adaption here in index dot HTML you can see it's always pointing to the PNG file directly but we have decided to put all that stuff into IMG into the IMG icons folder so I need to adapt it here and say I am G slash icons like so and that is needed here for all the path strings I have included here in my index dot HTML file playing like so you can see it so it's running and the next thing we need to do - we need to adapt the path strings here in the manifest.json file as well I simply need to remove the leading slash here to make that pass relative because all those files are in the same location and the same folder like the manifest file itself ok like so so next let's X down to manifest the dot adjacent have a little bit first we are going to change the name here to my PW a test F and then I'm adding a few more properties first of all I'm adding a property which is called short underscore name and I'm assigning the string pw8 test here then I'm adding a property which is called length which specifies the language of the application in this case it's er - us okay then I need to include a property start underscore URL let's just a slash it because we would like to set the start is a root of URL of our application as a star to RL next I'm going to specify a background color with background underscore color and I'm assigning a string here with a hexadecimal value which is 2 C 3 e 500k next scene color which is 1/8 BC 9c I think and next I'm setting a display mode which is standalone okay end of course the icons array here so that everything we need to set up a basic manifest.json file which is delivering all the information we need okay so we can do a quick check to see if our manifest.json file is interpreted correctly and does not contain any errors here on the web site in Chrome I can open up the chrome development tools okay and here on the let's close it here on the application tab you can see you do have the menu item manifest and clicking on manifest gives you the following view here on the right side you can see the location of our manifest.json file here then you can see the information we have entered name short name start URL the colors the display mode and so on so everything is interpreted correctly and is available here to our application if I scroll a little bit down you can see on our icon definitions included into JSON file and it's displaying the icons in the different sizes as you can see here so the path information is correct all icons are available and so if you know if you now would put map with this application at your mobile device it would read in the manifest and then request if you would like to add that progressive web application as an icon to you home screen so after having a completed our web app manifest file we need to add the second main building block of a progressive web application and that is a serviceworker so what is a serviceworker a serviceworker is a JavaScript file basically which is added to the project and registered in the browser all the serviceworker is clipped unable to run in the background and perform certain tasks so you do not need to have the webpage open in the browser once it has been requested and it has been open in the browser the Service Worker is installed and then it's running even if you close a web page and go to wizard other pages or even if you close the browser and so what are the typical tasks a service worker can perform so you can use a service worker for different tasks one task would be you can recognize the network state and display a special page if no network connection is available or for example you can add application pages or application data to you the browser cache when you are online and then when the service worker detects it no network connection is there you can implement the service worker to them fulfill the request from the cache so that the user sees an offline version of the page but no error page he sees actually the page record is has been stored in the cache before and now is available and can be delivered from the browser cache which is great another use case would be you can display push notifications to the user even if in cases when the user is not wizarding the website right now and delivering push notifications for example is it's very good tool because it brings the attention of users back to your website you can inform about special events about new articles new blog posts on your website and bring up notifications and then the user can click on the notification and it takes takes the user back to your website so you can see this worker is a concept which is very powerful and in the following we will see how to add a service worker to our web application here for the purpose to install a caching mechanism so that files are stored into the cache and then we will see we can close a network connection so that no connection to the server is there and see how our application is delivered in an offline version from the cache so let's get started so there are different ways of adding a service worker to our application of course you can start implementing the service worker from scratch to make it a little bit simpler we will use again a generator which is available here it PW a builder comm that's at the website and you can see if I could here on the second step of the generator both service worker it takes me to the following website here which says select the service worker functionality for you apt and I can now choose between different types of service worker functionality it starts with offline page then we have the offline copy of pages offline copy which back up offline page and so on so all those service workers have a different functionality a different caching strategy may be included and for example the first one here is at the easiest on offline page this sounds worker is simply checking the network connection and if there is no network connection it serves a special offline dot HTML page as you can see here which needs to be added of course to your application but the type of service work I'd like to add to our application the offline copy of Patriot Service Worker it stores a copy of each page into the browser cache at the moment the visitor is viewing that page and this allows as you can read here wizard to to load any previously viewed page while they are offline because those pages are available in our browser cache and so the cache is able to fulfill the request is there is no network connection so let's select that one and then you can see the generator is giving me the source code I do need and there are a two part of source code I needed to add to my website first of all I need to copy here the code for web site into a script element in index.html that is the code which is needed to register is a serviceworker for my application in the browser so it checks if there is already negative service work of former website if no it registered that serviceworker and the next in the next quote code sector the next source code section here is giving me the task code which is needed to implement the serviceworker itself and that source code will be inserted into a file which is called you can see it here because that is a file which is used for registering the serviceworker which is called PWA builder - SW dot j s so we need to create that file insert that source code here and add the code which is needed for registration into our index.html so let's start with the first part so here was an index.html let's scroll down and in another word a script section right here okay so let's include a command as well so that is a part where we are doing the service worker registration okay and we have a script element here we're setting the time to text slash yeah script okay and then I'm copying the script code here from the first section code for website so copy it here and paste it here okay so like so so let's quickly go through the code you can see it here it uses a navigator service worker dot controller object check if this controller is existing if this is the case it print out an error message because that is the indicator which shows that an active service worker is found for our website so we do not need to register another worker here is that's not the case it uses the navigator dot service worker dot registration method to pass at the first string parameter of your path over the file name which contains the year implementation of the server worker and then in the second parameter passing over and configuration object which in our case only contains the property scope which is set to route so to the root folder so this simply counts the service workers that it should control the entire application and if presid registration has been completed successfully it prints a message here to the console the same service worker has been registered for scope and then printing out this Cobra which has been set here so if I now check in my running application here in the browser the Ponzo you can see on getting back arrows and that's quite clear because the file which has been passed overview to the registry method PW a builder - tells W dot KS is not existing yet so on it gives me an error here so our next task is to create that file within my project so let's say new file and then the name is PW a builder - swas okay here we are and now I can go back to PW a builder calm and then take a copy the code from the section serviceworker code and in third that piece of code here into my new file okay let's save it okay so it's again quickly go through the code basically there are two sections in this code it's adding two event listeners first it's adding the install event listener and second it's adding here below the fetch event listener and what the service worker is doing is that it responds to the install event by executing this function here in the install event is called once the the index page is viewed for the first time and if that is the case you can see it's creating its opening up a new browser cache here and then inserting by calling cached output and asserting that index dot HTML file to the cache so after having executed this function the cache is created at the first page is inverted and then as a service worker is responding to the fetch event and the fetch event is called whenever the user tries to access a new resource for no application and the patch on event method or function is basically doing two things so first it defines an inner function here update cache and it's attaching the update cache a function call here was wait until to the event queue and as the name of this function already of suggest it updates the cache with the assets which have been requested here still every time the user is sending a request for maybe index.html or another outside here to the server update cache makes sure that the browser application cache is updated with the resources next you you can see here is with responds with attaching another thing to the queue here the service worker is making use of fetch catch to respond to an error situation so maybe if the network connection is not there if the server is not reachable the function which is passed into the catch a call here is activated and then what the service worker is doing here basically is to see if the requested resources are already within the application cache so it opens up the cache with the open method and then here was cache dot match checks if the resource is available from the cache and if that is the case the reason the response is generated with the s from the cache if not an error page is displayed and so that's basically how the offline functionality is implemented so now we can make sure that our service worker is working at the browser is expected and again the chrome developer tools are helping us with that task and in again we are here in the manifest view and you can see here's an item right below this is called serviceworker here from the left-side menu and you can select it and now you can see that the service worker here already is addictive and running and you can see that the PWA builder - SW dot gif file has been registered as our service worker here for our web application you can register the souls over here if you like and you can see here down in the cache section within cache start that the corresponding cache storage for our offline content has already been created and if I click on it you can see the first page with was added here it's index dot HTML and if I now perform another request here for the side and maybe select something here from the menu ok you can see that the content here in the cache is updated with all the assets which have been which have been part of a request and now I'm able to demonstrate well that my application is executed in offline mode so without any network connection and this is very simple to do so we just need to click here on the service workers of section again and then set the check box here at the option offline okay now the assets simulated that no network connection is Erica request the page once again and now you can see it's loaded again and here from the console you can see that the network connection of course is not there soon internet disconnected yes the arrow which is given here and then our service worker is taking over the task and it's saying servant content from cache and that is the message we are getting because we are working an offline mode so okay we can switch back of course into online mode and now you can see if I request it again now everything is loaded from the server in no internet connection error and all the assets all the pages all the images are are added again the new version is added to the cache so that is everything up to date with the latest website content so if you start developing progressive web apps is always kept - to have the opportunity to make a quick check and see if your application complies to all the progressive web app standards and rules and there is a tool from Google which makes it extremely easy and I'd like to show you White House and lighthouse can be found here at developers.google.com/plus web search towards fresh lighthouse and lighthouse is generating a report which gives you kpi's as indications of how good your progressive web app complies to rules and it generates a report with with action items that gives you the possibility to directly deal with the problems in your progressive web app and to solve those problems to get a higher rating and that house can be installed here as a Chrome and on I've already installed it you can see it here that the lighthouse icon here and if I would like to check now our application here I simply need to activate that tap here the application is already Weibull here and now I can click on that lighthouse button and advanced a general report and now it takes a few seconds the lighthouse is checking the website checking all the PWA routes and then generating a report so here we are as you can see that as a result here you can see the KPI is giving you information about the progressive web app itself so we have a rating of 82 which is which is good performance it's not so good of course we are running a server here on on localhost accessibility is quite good and best practices although with a rating of 92% quite good and we have here from the audit advanced we failed audit so we can now work on for example it says that we need to serve our PWA with HTTPS of course if we are working in a productive environment it says that we need although an icon in the size of 512 pixels and it gives me all the information that I have to remove here is a property a shrink to fit which is set to know from the meta viewport element okay so this was passing again from coding the smart way I hope that you enjoyed my video if you do like my tutorials please subscribe to my channel on youtube please also don't forget to visit my blog at coding the smart way comm and I hope very much to see you in the next video thanks and bye\""
